Non-strict "template"

Please provide a sample or partial sample of the email you received with all personal info removed (name, office number, phone number, etc).  

Preferably, a short explanation of why it is considered spam if not obvious (i.e. "I saw your resume and it was a perfect fit" for a 15 years experience-required position when you are 22 years old)

Company names are obviously fine to be left in.
